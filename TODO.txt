--------------------
-- AirNet language
--------------------

- catch() function. Use only two mandatory arguments: FABRIC and FLOW.
  (in other words, make the "src" parameter optional)

  catch(fabric=FAB, flow=my_tag) >> carry(dst=to_edge)

  This reduces the number of catch policies. Flows going to the same edge destination
  from different sources can thus be grouped in a unique catch-carry policy.

- dynControlFunction : when returning a new Policy, is it possible to build the match
  without specifying the edge? in other words, being able to reuse the edge of the upper
  level policy (maybe by passing it as a parameter or through the decorator?)

  Example:
    match(edge=LB, nw_src=..., nw_dst=...) >> Dynamic_LB()

    @DynamicControlFct(data="packet", split=["nw_src"], limit=1)
    def Dynamic_LB(packet):
        ...
        if Dynamic_LB.token == 1:
            # *** the LB edge in the policy p below ***
            p = (match(edge="LB", nw_src=...) >> ... modify(...) >> forward(...))
            # ***

- Virtual composition: 2 matches having an intersection and different actions.
  Example:
    match(edge=X, nw_dst=D) >> tag(...) >> forward(...)
    match(edge=X, nw_dst=D, tp_dst=HTTP) >> drop(...)


-- Examples
------------

- statThreeEdges use case (for TouSIX)
  WORK IN PROGRESS.

-- Other
---------

- tools.py module: is it really useful? shouldn't it be somewhere else?

- TO DELETE: stage_runtime.py, stage_arp_proxy.py ??

- MOVE airnet/pox_client and airnet/ryu_client in folder airnet/backends/


***********************
*** DONE (by Mayoro)***
***********************

-- Examples
-------------

- Verifying and integrating checkDataCap use case.
  DONE.

-- RYU interface
------------------

- PACKET_OUT with dynamic control functions (with the RYU controller)
  (to inject the first packet back into the data plane)
  DONE.

- STATISTICS in dynamic control functions. OK in POX but what about RYU?
  DONE in RYU.

- Default LLDP rule added by RYU in OF table: where does it come from? is it working?
  DONE:
  ---> It comes from RYU's default behavior.
  ---> to remove, call ryu-manager with the --noinstall-lldp-flow option

- Add TABLE-MISS with a drop in RYU's airnet_interface module
  DONE.

- Add ARP rule (forwarding to controller) in RYU's airnet_interface module, or elsewhere?
  Messaoud added them only on border switches!
  DONE. (on all switches for the moment)

- TO DELETE: controllers/ryu/ofctl_rest, controllers/ryu/appRyu
  DONE.

- RENAME in airnet_interface: class RestStatsApi and URI path '/stats'.
  DONE.

- UPGRADE interface to OpenFlow 1.3
  DONE.

-- Other
-----------

- Log module (from the virtual composition phase to the physical rules)
  DONE.
