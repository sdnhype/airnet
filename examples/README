            *** AirNet use cases ***
            ************************

Each use case is in a separate folder.

******************************************************************************
Basic use cases
******************************************************************************

== toyExample  ==

Example which allows HTTP and ICMP flows, and deny all other traffic.

== toyExampleClick  ==

Example which redirects all granted traffic through a DataMachine (this DM is
implemented in a separate VM thanks to the click modular router).

******************************************************************************
Static use cases
******************************************************************************

== staticFiltering  ==

Example which filters traffic based on the destination host,
the network and/or transport protocol and/or port number.

== staticParallelCatch  ==

Example which involves 2 catch() instructions in parallel with the same
destination in the carry().
e.g.: ( catch() + catch() ) >> carry()

== staticTwoFabrics  ==

Example which involves 2 fabrics in the virtual topology.

******************************************************************************
Dynamic use cases (dynamic network control function(s) is(are) used here)
******************************************************************************

== statThreeEdges  ==

Example which collects statistics based on layer 2 exchanges.

== checkDataCap  ==

Example which regulates bandwidth usage.

== dynAuthentication ==

Example which authenticates flows based on the IP source address of the first packet.

== dynDM ==

Example which redirects non-trustworthy flows through a DataMachine (this DM is
implemented in a separate VM thanks to the click modular router).

== dynLB ==

Example which balances traffic between two web servers according to a simple
round-robin algorithm.
